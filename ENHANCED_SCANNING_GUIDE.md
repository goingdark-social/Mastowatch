# Mastowatch Enhanced Scanning System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive enhancements made to the Mastowatch scanning system and rules management, addressing the inefficiencies in the original system and adding powerful new features for federated content monitoring and rule management.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Scanning Logic

#### Problem Solved
The original scanning system repeatedly looped over the same rule for a single user, failing to move forward to other accounts or users efficiently.

#### Solution
- **Smart Content Deduplication**: Implemented content hashing to detect when account content hasn't changed
- **Cursor-based Progression**: Enhanced cursor management ensures systematic progression through all accounts
- **Session Tracking**: Scan sessions track progress across multiple users and accounts
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent caching prevents unnecessary re-processing of unchanged content

#### Key Components
- `EnhancedScanningSystem` class in `app/enhanced_scanning.py`
- `ContentScan` model for tracking processed content
- `ScanSession` model for managing scan progress
- Enhanced job tasks with better error handling and progression

### 2. Federated Domain Handling

#### Features
- **Domain Violation Tracking**: Automatic tracking of violations per domain
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set custom defederation thresholds per domain
- **Automated Defederation**: Automatic marking of domains for defederation when thresholds are exceeded
- **Risk Assessment**: High-risk domains (approaching threshold) are highlighted for manual review

#### Models
- `DomainAlert` model tracks violations and defederation status
- Configurable thresholds with default value of 10 violations
- Automated tracking with manual override capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Rules Management

#### User Interface Improvements
- **Intuitive Rule Creation**: User-friendly interface with examples and descriptions
- **Rule Toggle**: Enable/disable rules without deletion

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Federated Scan
```bash
# Scan all active domains
curl -X POST /scanning/federated

# Scan specific domains
curl -X POST /scanning/federated \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domains": ["example.com", "test.social"]}'
```

### Managing Rules via API
```bash
# Create a new rule
curl -X POST /rules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "spam_keywords",
    "rule_type": "content_regex",
    "pattern": "spam|scam|phishing",
    "weight": 0.8,
    "description": "Detects common spam keywords"
  }'

# Toggle multiple rules
curl -X POST /rules/bulk-toggle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "enabled": false
  }'
```

### Monitoring Domain Violations
```bash
# Get domain analytics
curl /analytics/domains

# Trigger domain violation check
curl -X POST /scanning/domain-check
```

## Best Practices

### Rule Creation
1. **Start with Low Weights**: Begin with weights â‰¤ 0.5 and adjust based on results
2. **Test Patterns**: Use the dry-run mode to test regex patterns before deployment
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check rule statistics regularly to identify ineffective rules
4. **Document Rules**: Always add descriptions to custom rules

### Scanning Optimization
1. **Cache Management**: Invalidate cache only when necessary to maintain performance
2. **Session Monitoring**: Monitor active scan sessions to prevent overlapping scans
3. **Domain Thresholds**: Set appropriate defederation thresholds based on instance size

### Monitoring
1. **Dashboard Review**: Regular review of all dashboard tabs for system health
2. **Alert Setup**: Configure alerts for high domain violation rates
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor scan completion times and cache hit rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Scanning Performance
- Check content cache hit rate in `/analytics/scanning`
- Consider increasing `CONTENT_CACHE_TTL`
- Monitor database performance with slow query logging

#### High Domain Violations
- Review domain analytics in `/domains` tab
- Adjust `DEFEDERATION_THRESHOLD` if needed
- Manually review high-risk domains

#### Rule Performance Issues
- Check rule statistics in `/analytics/rules/statistics`
- Identify rules with high trigger counts but low effectiveness
- Consider adjusting rule weights or patterns

### Error Recovery
- Scan sessions automatically recover from failures
- Failed scans can be restarted via the dashboard
- Content cache can be invalidated to force fresh scans
