Additional Terms under AGPLv3 §7(b) — Author Attribution (UI)

If the Program or any modified version provides an interactive user interface,
you must preserve an “Appropriate Legal Notice” that is readily visible to users.
That notice must include:

  “Made for goingdark.social”  (hyperlinked to https://goingdark.social)

Visibility & placement: The notice must appear on every user-visible page or
screen where the Program renders UI (e.g., a persistent footer or a fixed
Credits/About link visible on every page that opens a screen containing the
notice). It must have prominence no less than the default body text and must
not be obscured.

This clause is an author-attribution requirement permitted by AGPLv3 §7(b).
It does not grant any trademark rights. Non-compliance terminates your rights
under AGPLv3 per Section 8.
