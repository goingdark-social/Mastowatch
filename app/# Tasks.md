# Tasks

There is a lot of inline comments. The code should be clean and self explanitory. if there is a need for a inline comment the code is to confusing and should instead be rewriten.

A lot of past or future tense is used in code. it should be named as it is NOW. For example bad names: V2 ,Enhanced_scanning etc. If there is 2 versions it should be made dry. if there is only one thats even worse. code should be now.
